## 📌 Project Description
This Python-based console application simulates a small cafe ordering system.
It stores all available dishes along with their prices in a dictionary.
The user can:
1. View the menu
1. Select food items to order
1. Add multiple items
1. Get a final bill at the end
The program checks item availability and calculates the total amount based on selected items.

This project helps beginners understand how to:
- Use Python dictionaries
- Validate user input
- Build a menu-driven application
- Implement simple billing logic

  --------
## ▶️ How It Works

1. The program displays the cafe menu
1. The user enters the item they want to order
1. If the item exists → added to the bill
1. If not → shows an "Item not available" message
1. Asks if the user wants to order more items
1. When done → displays the total bill

##💡 Future Enhancements
- GUI interface using Tkinter
- Add quantity for each order
- Add GST & discount system
- Save bills using file handling
- Store menu data using JSON
